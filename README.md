# modorganizer2-linux-installer-gui
This is a rewrite of the [modorganizer2-linux-installer](furglitch/modorganizer2-linux-installer) fork that I maintain, switched to Python and added a GUI

This is *purely for practice*. I do not recommend anyone use this over the original project (linked above), nor do I intend for this to ever replace the project. That being said, I do appreciate insight into any issues that could be fixed or optimizations I could make.
